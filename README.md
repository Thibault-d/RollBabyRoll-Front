## Description

Chosing the best stroller for your baby shouldn't require a PhD.
Roll Baby Roll is the best (and only!) Stroller comparator, so you can quickly see and compare what matters for you.

## Motivation

For the Front-End, I want to push my experience in React by using multiple filtering, ranking, global context and other features.
