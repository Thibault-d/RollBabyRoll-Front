## Description

Chosing the best stroller for your baby shouldn't require a PhD.
Roll Baby Roll is the best Stroller comparator, so you can quickly see and compare what matters for you.

## Motivation

For the Front-End, I want to push my experience in React by using multiple filtering, ranking, global context and other features.

## User Stories

**View All** - As a user I want to land on the page containing the listing of all Strollers existing in the DB

**Filter strollers** - As a regular user, I want to be able to filter using a wide range of criterias

**Rank strollers** - As a regular user, I want to be able to rank a list of stroller using a wide range of criterias

**Add to comparison** - As a regular user, I want to be able to add / remove strollers from the comparator

**404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault

**500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault
